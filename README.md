## Project Overview
A single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood that user like to visit. The map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.
## Why this Project?
The neighborhood map application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages. 
## What did I Learn?
How design patterns and UI libraries like React assist in developing a manageable codebase. Explored how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities to use. Finally, implemented third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of the application.
## How does this help my Career?
- React is an in-demand technology for Front-End Web Developers
- Interacting with API servers is the primary function of Front-End Web Developers
- Use of third-party libraries and APIs is a standard and acceptable practice that is encouraged
- Asynchronous programming is important to understand in today's market

## Project Requirements
1. Neighborhood Map (React) project showing BART locations in the San Francisco Bay Area. Clicking a marker on the map should open more information about that location.

2. Clicking a name in the list view should display the information for the associated marker.

3. The list of locations should be filterable with a text input or dropdown menu. Filtering the list also filters the markers on the map.

4. The web app should be responsive (i.e., to mobile devices). Note that a hamburger menu icon used to hide the list on small screens (this is just one possible mobile implementation).
